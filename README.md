# KPApps
The code for the caraamad app that is submitted for the KPApps competition

Please use a 7z compressor to decompress this folder. Due to size limit on github, we had to compress it for uploading.
The folder contains 3 sub folders:
1. The android project for the prototype of the app
2. The apk files which can directly be installed on any android phone for viewing the app
3. The document containing information of what's implemented in this prototype and what's yet to be implemented.
